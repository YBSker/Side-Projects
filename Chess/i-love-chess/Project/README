DESIGN -
We use dynamic dispatch as required for the pieces.
We have a function called is_legal_move which checks if a move from one square to another in a legal move
We then have a function called make_move which actually does the move, but it calls is_legal_move to check if it's legal. Checking that you
    don't move into check is done in make_move, however.
The function in_check goes through all possible moves from the opponent to see if there's any possible way they can "move" onto your king's square.
    if there is, it return true, which means you're in check, and otherwise returns false.
The functions in_mate and in_stalemate are similar. in_mate check that you are in check and that no possible move you can make can get you into
    a position where you are not in check. in_stalemate does the same except that it first checks that you are not already in check.


COMPLETENESS-
We hope it all works correctly.
