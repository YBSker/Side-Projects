c static is a subcase of c init
2 * cstatic...c static is subcase of c init so applies similarly....where does n^2 comes from

potentail funct related to how many steps to how sort things...
n^2 is a result of the potential funct 

number of swaps not based on like 

CMTF + N^2/2 leq cstatic
cstatic meq cmtf + n^2/2
cmtf leq 2cstatic + n^2

diff between index and cstatic and index and cinit
	same as number of swaps
	cinit add smth to cinit side looking for maximum distance between 2 things...each element would be n-1 max distance
	and then get n^2


diff cstatic and cinit difference between indices and one from cstatic and one from cinit
max distance is n-1 worst case

follwos naturally from cinit

lO-ln in page 3 AA notes find out how become n^2
	why i=0 until n? worst case we need to change n-1
	so this is worst worst case...its rounded
